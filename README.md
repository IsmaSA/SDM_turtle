# Potential distribution, observed impacts, and invasion risk of two non-native snapping turtles, *Chelydra serpentina* and *Macrochelys temminckii*

**Abstract** 	 	

Among reptiles, turtles are the most frequently traded and introduced species, and are often released in the wild once they become unwanted as pets. The common snapping turtle Chelydra serpentina and the alligator snapping turtle Macrochelys temminckii are freshwater turtles native to North America. Although their trade is regulated in some countries, they have been introduced worldwide as pets. While C. serpentina already has some established self-sustaining populations outside its native range, there are no such reports for M. temminckii. However, there are increasing records from the wild for both species, and a thorough assessment of the potential climatic suitability, observed impacts and invasiveness of these two species has never been performed. Here, we combined Species Distribution Models (SDMs) under current and future climatic scenarios, standardized scoring impact systems (EICAT(+) and SEICAT) and invasiveness risk assessments (AS-ISK). Our results show a wider climatic suitability for C. serpentina outside its native range but no highly suitable areas outside theits native range of for M. temminckii. Our models also revealed a decrease in climatic suitability for both species in their native range under future climate scenarios, raising potential concerns for their conservation. Only C. serpentina could be assessed for its impacts, being attributed a minor impact score. The invasiveness risk assessments attributed a medium risk to C. serpentina and a low risk to M. temminckii. In any case, Our results suggest, anyway, that proper data collection outside both species’ native ranges are necessary to monitor the status of these as alien species.
